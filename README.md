This is a simple terminal-based game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and your goal is to guess it. At the start, you choose a difficulty level: Easy gives you 12 attempts, Medium gives you 8 attempts, and Hard gives you only 5 attempts. After each guess, the game tells you whether your number is too low, too high, or correct. If you guess the number within the allowed attempts, you win and your score (number of attempts) may become your best record for the session. If you fail to guess in time, the game reveals the secret number. After each round, you can decide whether to play again, and your best score is saved until you quit.
